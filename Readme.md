# Guess the number game

**Status**: In making

## Description
A simple guess the number game where Python program generates a random number and player tries to guess it.

## Notes
- import the random module
- define a function
- randint(a,b) range of ab
- Initial guess so that it's not between the range
- Using while loop because we don't have predefined numbers to iterate over
- With if statement create structure where it returns whether input is higher or lower.

# Features
Program genrates the number with Random library
